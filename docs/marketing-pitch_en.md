# Stop Letting AI Write Code Directly For You — Addressing "Architecture Collapse" in the AI Programming Era

Have you experienced this moment of despair?
You give an AI a requirement, and it grunts out hundreds of lines of code in seconds. It looks decent at first, but when you run it, it throws an error. You feed the error back, and it changes another hundred lines. Three rounds later, your business logic is mangled beyond recognition, your once-clean architecture is spaghetti, and you tearfully run `git revert`.

**The core pain point isn't that models aren't smart enough; it's that we confuse "reasoning" with "coding".**

When senior human developers receive complex requirements, they first draw architecture diagrams, design database schemas, and confirm state transitions *before* writing code. Why do we expect AI to do it in one leap?

To end this "Prompt -> Random Code -> Error -> Prompt" death loop, we open-sourced **OpenSpecs (Speckit Layered)**.

### 🚀 What is OpenSpecs?
It is a **Document-Stage Framework** designed specifically for AI Agents.
Think of it as putting "engineering guardrails" around a runaway AI.

### 💡 How Hardcore Is It?

**1. Forced "Chain of Thought" Serialization**
AI is not allowed to modify code directly. It is forced to follow our two-layer workflow:
First `sp.specify` (Requirement Definition) -> `sp.clarify` (Disambiguation) -> `sp.gate` (State Check)
*Then* `sp.plan` (Planning).
Every step of the AI's reasoning is crystallized into local Markdown files. You can read it, review it, and intervene if necessary.

**2. Query-First Memory Routing to Solve "Context Explosion"**
Stop blindly dumping codebases with dozens of tables and APIs into a 1M Context model—it will lose focus!
OpenSpecs introduces a strictly defined `.specify/memory` routing table. When an Agent joins, step one is reading the index; step two is extracting the exact "Minimum Read Set" for the current Feature. Token consumption drops drastically, and logic analysis accuracy skyrockets.

**3. "Worksets" for Handling Large Projects**
When a requirement is massive, the framework automatically chunks tasks (Worksets). Each time the AI works, it only carries the context for the current closed-loop area, decoupling mental baggage just like microservices do.

**4. Fully Compatible Platform Protocol Layer**
The core underlying standard is always `sp.*`. Whether you type `/sp.specify` in Claude Code or `$sp-specify` in Codex, it adapts perfectly and seamlessly.

---
**AI has the capability to churn out code at lightning speed, but it lacks the rigor and restraint of human engineers.**

If you want to use AI to maintain medium-to-large complex systems, and if you don't want your project to become an untouchable "AI mudball" in a month, it's time to re-teach AI the rules of software engineering.
