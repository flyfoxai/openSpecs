# `sp` 命令模板草案

> 目标：把 `sp` 命令规范继续细化为可迁入原版 `Spec Kit` fork 的命令正文草案。

## 1. 使用方式

这份文档不是运行时实现，而是模板层设计稿。

后续 fork 原版 `Spec Kit` 时，可将这里的正文迁移到不同 agent 的命令模板文件中：

- slash command agent 使用 `/sp.*`
- skills 型 agent 按 upstream 原方式安装
- Codex skills 模式使用 `$sp-*`

要求：

- 两种触发方式复用同一套正文语义
- 差异只放在命令文件位置、文件命名和 agent 特定包装
- 不同 agent 不应拥有不同的业务流程定义

## 2. 全局模板约束

每个命令模板都应先继承以下全局约束：

- 当前阶段只做文档工作，不进入代码实现
- 必须优先读取已有产物，不能凭空重写
- 必须显式暴露缺口、冲突、待确认问题和阻塞项
- 必须把输出落到 `specs/<feature>/` 下的标准路径
- 如果当前步骤的输入尚不稳定，应停止扩写并指出回退步骤
- 如果 `memory/index.md` 已存在，必须先读它
- 只针对当前目标区域展开源文档，不要默认重读整个 feature
- 如果本步改变了稳定事实、开放问题、追踪链或局部工作面，必须刷新对应 `memory/*`
- `memory/*` 的首屏优先放查询入口、过滤表和热点项，不优先放长段总结
- 小窗口 agent 首轮默认不超过 `7` 个文件，中窗口默认不超过 `9` 个文件，大窗口默认不超过 `12` 个文件
- `.specify/memory/active-context.md` 给出的项目级最小阅读集默认不超过 `5` 个文件
- 默认先路由到 `1` 个 active feature，再路由到 `1` 个主 workset
- 若 `screens >= 12`、`flows >= 12`、`tables >= 20`，或已出现两个以上明显子主题，则 `sp.plan` 至少拆成 `2` 个 `ws-*.md`
- 若 `screens >= 20`、`flows >= 20`、`tables >= 40`，或已跨两个以上业务域，则按接近中型规模处理
- 若规模达到或接近 `50` 个界面、`50` 条流程、`100` 张表，则视为中型项目工作负载，`sp.analyze` 未执行冒烟检查时不得判 `PASS`

推荐在每个命令正文前附一段统一前言：

```text
You are executing the document-stage `sp` workflow on top of the original Spec Kit mechanism.
Stay within documentation work only.
Reuse existing project context and active feature state.
Do not write production code.
If `.specify/memory/project-index.md` exists, read it first and use it as the project routing entry.
If `.specify/memory/active-context.md` exists, use it to pick the current smallest useful read set.
If `memory/index.md` exists, read it first and use it as the default routing entry.
Expand to source documents only for the current target area.
Respect the query-first memory layout and keep the read set within the current context budget.
Route to one active feature and one primary workset by default unless the task explicitly requires a broader comparison.
If required inputs are missing or unstable, stop and report the gap explicitly.
```

## 3. 命令正文草案

## 3.1 `sp.constitution`

调用形式：

- slash command agent: `/sp.constitution`
- Codex skills: `$sp-constitution`

正文草案：

```text
Purpose
- Establish the project constitution for the layered document workflow.
- Define hard boundaries between business clarification and delivery design.

Read First
- Read current project README and any existing constitution or team principles.
- Read the layered workflow rules and command spec if they already exist.

Do
- Write or update the constitution so it explicitly states:
- this project uses a two-layer document workflow
- the current stage covers documentation only
- flow assets use Mermaid
- UI documentation uses Markdown plus JSON Forms
- second-layer work starts only after gate passes
- the document workflow stops at `sp.analyze`
- Preserve compatibility with the original Spec Kit workflow where practical.

Do Not
- Do not start writing feature documents.
- Do not define production code standards here.
- Do not leave ambiguous stage boundaries.

Output
- Update `.specify/memory/constitution.md`
- Update `.specify/memory/project-index.md`
- Update `.specify/memory/feature-map.md`
- Update `.specify/memory/domain-map.md`

```

## 3.2 `sp.specify`

调用形式：

- slash command agent: `/sp.specify`
- Codex skills: `$sp-specify`

正文草案：

```text
Purpose
- Create the first baseline requirement document for the active feature.
- Capture what the feature is and why it matters.

Read First
- Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
- Read `.specify/memory/project-index.md` if it exists.
- Read the user request, related notes, and any existing docs for the active feature.

Do
- Write `spec.md` for the active feature.
- Capture business objective, target users or roles, in-scope items, out-of-scope items, and success criteria.
- Keep the language requirement-focused and business-focused.
- Separate user goals from solution ideas if both appear in the input.
- Register the active feature in `.specify/memory/feature-map.md`.
- Refresh `.specify/memory/active-context.md` so later agents can route into this feature quickly.

Do Not
- Do not write code, architecture, database, API, framework, or deployment design.
- Do not silently convert assumptions into decisions.

Output
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
- Create or update `.specify/memory/feature-map.md`

```

## 3.3 `sp.clarify`

调用形式：

- slash command agent: `/sp.clarify`
- Codex skills: `$sp-clarify`

正文草案：

```text
Purpose
- Act as the unified clarification entry for document-stage business decisions.
- Resolve high-impact gaps or conflicts coming from `spec`, `flow`, or `ui`.

Read First
- If `specs/<feature>/memory/index.md` exists, read it first.
- If `specs/<feature>/memory/open-items.md` exists, read it before asking new questions.
- Read `specs/<feature>/spec.md`
- Read `specs/<feature>/clarifications.md` if it exists.
- Read `specs/<feature>/clarify-log.md` if it exists.
- Read the current source area if the issue came from `flows/*` or `ui/*`.
- Read any user follow-up notes and prior clarification records.

Do
- Identify whether each question belongs to `CF-SPEC`, `CF-FLOW`, or `CF-UI`.
- Decide whether each question is `Immediate` or `Batch`.
- Ask macro route questions first before local detail questions.
- Treat a question as `Immediate` if it changes scope, mainline stages, primary page grouping, owner boundaries, or blocks the current step.
- Treat a question as `Batch` only if it is local, safe to defer, and can be grouped with the same topic without changing the route.
- Group deferred questions by `Queue Topic` instead of by document order.
- Flush a batch queue when the same topic reaches `3` pending items, when the same workset loops twice on the same uncertainty, or before `sp.gate`, `sp.bundle`, or `sp.plan`.
- If a batch queue cannot be flushed into one safe structured question, step back and ask a higher-level route question immediately.
- If the issue came from a flow or UI adjustment request, resolve the natural-language description to a single `Target ID` before proposing options.
- Use standard modification sentence patterns when drafting or restating the question:
- `把 <Target ID> 的 <属性> 改成 <新值>`
- `删除 <Target ID>，并把 <影响对象> 并入 <目标对象>`
- `把 <Target ID> 从 <旧 Owner ID> 移到 <新 Owner ID>`
- `把 <Target ID> 拆成 <新 Target ID A> 和 <新 Target ID B>`
- `把 <Target ID A> 和 <Target ID B> 合并为 <新 Target ID>`
- If the user speaks in natural language, restate the resolved mapping explicitly, for example:
- `申请页提交按钮` -> `ACTION-LEAVE-APPLY-020`
- `审批页驳回原因框` -> `FIELD-LEAVE-APPROVAL-010`
- `列表页筛选区` -> `SECTION-LEAVE-LIST-010`
- Write the business framework before detailed flows:
- define the business mainline stages
- define actor responsibility boundaries across those stages
- define how core objects move through the business mainline
- define key decision points and explicit out-of-scope extensions
- keep the framework in a fixed section order for consistency across features
- Expand role definitions, business objects, rules, state changes, branches, exceptions, defaults, overrides, and acceptance examples.
- Default to single-select or multi-select questions with optional remarks.
- Keep single-select questions at `2` to `4` options when possible.
- Keep multi-select questions at `2` to `6` safely composable options when possible.
- Generate only bounded options that fit the current framework and do not create hidden contradictions.
- If safe low-level options cannot be formed, step back and ask a more macro route question instead.
- Record open questions separately when the input is not strong enough for a decision.
- Update `spec.md` only where clarification stabilizes the baseline requirement.
- Write stable conclusions to `clarifications.md`.
- Write the question history, options, selected answers, impact scope, revisit conditions, and when applicable `Target Type`, `Target ID`, `Canonical Name`, `Alias Keywords`, `Owner ID`, `Operation`, `Affected IDs`, `Affected Documents`, `Queue Topic`, `Queue Size`, `Flush Trigger`, and `Latest Safe Step` to `clarify-log.md`.

Do Not
- Do not jump to process diagrams, UI design, or delivery design.
- Do not hide rule conflicts.
- Do not create separate command surfaces such as `cf_spec`, `cf_flow`, or `cf_ui`.
- Do not rely on open free-form answers when a safe structured question can be asked.
- Do not modify a flow or UI object before the target-resolution path is explicit enough for another agent to reproduce.

Output
- Update `specs/<feature>/spec.md` if the baseline requirement changed.
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/clarifications.md` if a stable conclusion changed.
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/clarify-log.md`
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/memory/stable-context.md`
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/memory/open-items.md`
- Create or update `specs/<feature>/memory/trace-index.md`

Check Before Finish
- Confirm the business framework is explicit enough that another agent can explain the feature top-down before reading any diagrams.
- Confirm the framework uses this fixed order:
- `Mainline Stages`
- `Stage Responsibility Boundaries`
- `Object Flow Backbone`
- `Top-Level Decision Points`
- `Capability Boundaries`
- Confirm each clarification item is tagged as `CF-SPEC`, `CF-FLOW`, or `CF-UI`.
- Confirm blocking route-level questions were asked immediately.
- Confirm deferred local questions were explicitly queued for batch clarification.
- Confirm no `Batch` question changed route, scope, owner, mainline stage, or primary page grouping.
- Confirm each batch queue has an explicit `Queue Topic`, `Flush Trigger`, and `Latest Safe Step`.
- Confirm all pending batch queues were checked for mandatory flush before `sp.gate`, `sp.bundle`, or `sp.plan`.
- Confirm question options are mutually exclusive or safely composable.
- Confirm stable conclusions are in `clarifications.md` and decision history is in `clarify-log.md`.
- Confirm every flow or UI change request can be traced to a unique `Target ID`.
- Confirm the target-resolution path is recoverable from `Canonical Name`, `Alias Keywords`, `Owner ID`, and source links.
- Confirm key rules include applicability, priority, and exceptions.
- Confirm open questions are explicit.
- Confirm no technical design has leaked in.
- Confirm the stable context, open items, and trace entry have been refreshed.

Next
- If this clarification came right after `sp.specify`, suggest `sp.flow`.
- If it was triggered from `sp.flow` or `sp.ui`, suggest returning to that blocked step.

## 3.10 `sp.analyze`

调用形式：

- slash command agent: `/sp.analyze`
- Codex skills: `$sp-analyze`

正文草案：

```text
Purpose
- Analyze cross-document consistency and find structural gaps across the document workflow.

Read First
- Read `.specify/memory/project-index.md` first if it exists.
- Read `.specify/memory/active-context.md` if it exists.
- Read `specs/<feature>/memory/index.md` first if it exists.
- Read `specs/<feature>/memory/stable-context.md`, `open-items.md`, `trace-index.md`, and `worksets/*` if they exist.
- Read `spec.md`, `clarifications.md`, `flows/*`, `ui/*`, `bundle.md`, `plan.md`, `delivery/*`, and `tasks.md`

Do
- Identify broken mappings, contradictions, missing dependencies, and false assumptions of completeness.
- Check whether flows align with screens, whether rules align with delivery objects, whether table, API, permission, and event documents stay mutually consistent, and whether tasks align with acceptance.
- Judge whether the document set has reached the minimum supplementary precision for later automatic development.
- If the feature has reached medium-project scale, run a smoke check on representative flows, screens, APIs, and tables, and record the sampling basis.
- If the feature is near medium-project scale, explicitly judge whether the split structure, query structure, and workset routing still hold.
- Categorize each gap under UI, API, data, permission, side-effect, or acceptance precision.
- Produce a final verdict using `PASS`, `PASS WITH RISKS`, or `BLOCKED`.
- Structure the result so the final verdict and gap categories can be compared across features rather than written as freeform prose.

- Check whether `memory/*` is stale, incomplete, or inconsistent with the source docs.
- Check whether any workset is too broad, missing key links, or no longer represents a local work area.
- Refresh `.specify/memory/hotspots.md` with project-level high-priority risks.
- Refresh `.specify/memory/project-index.md` and `.specify/memory/feature-map.md` with the latest readiness result.

- Create or update `specs/<feature>/analysis.md`
- Create or update `.specify/memory/project-index.md`
- Create or update `.specify/memory/feature-map.md`
- Create or update `.specify/memory/hotspots.md`

Check Before Finish
- Confirm every finding includes evidence and impact.
- Confirm every finding includes a precision category when relevant.
- If medium-project scale applies, confirm the smoke-test scope, sampling summary, and verdict impact are written.
- If the feature is medium-project workload, confirm `PASS` is not used when the smoke test is missing.
- Confirm the result includes a fixed verdict block and a fixed gap-category table.
- Confirm the final verdict is explicit and consistent with the passline criteria.
- Confirm the result makes clear whether the document stage is coherent enough to stop or must loop back.
- Confirm the analysis states whether the external memory layer is fresh enough to serve as the default routing entry.
- Confirm the project-level risk and readiness indexes were refreshed.

Next
- If major gaps remain, suggest the exact prior command to revisit.
- If no major gaps remain, stop at the end of the document stage.

## 4. 后续迁移建议

将这份文档迁入真实 fork 时，建议顺序如下：

1. 先将全局约束写入 constitution 与命令模板公共片段
2. 再落地 `sp.specify` 到 `sp.analyze` 的 agent 命令文件
3. 最后分别为 slash command agent 与 Codex skills 补目录包装

迁移时应保持：

- 同一步命令在不同 agent 上的正文逻辑一致
- 文档阶段边界一致
- 输出路径一致
